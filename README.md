# Calculator
This is a work from "The Odin Project", a virtual Calculator:
- The feature has a double screen in which it records the previous entries.
- It has a button to exchange the input of both windows.
- It does everything that a classic calculator would do.

You can use the numeric keypad and the additional controls are:
- Arrows Up and Down: to exchange screen values.
- Arrows Left and Right: to exchange the negative value.
- DELETE: to clear all inputs.
- BACKSPACE: to delete the last digit.
- ENTER: to solve.
